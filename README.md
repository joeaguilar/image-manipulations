These are a collection of image manipulation UI's

To make stuff happen clone the repo and follow these steps.

1.) Open the index.html file in a browser.

2.) Include the script in any HTML file, then open in a browser.

The UI is generated via the javascript.

The UI is very basic, but with care you can craft your own with some CSS

I rather continue expirementing with algorithms.

#Enjoy!
